# Introduction 
This demo shows the use of Mass Transit (Serivce Bus) and Azure Service Bus (Transport) to allow MicroServices to remain decoupled.

# Getting Started
These services are intended to be deployed to Azure but this could easily be modified to work outside of azure as well. The slides for this talk are availabe [here](http://www.cameronvetter.com/2017/08/09/slides-code-posted-from-microservices-talk/)
